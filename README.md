# SoundScripter üîäüìù

Simplify and Automate your transcription workflow with SoundScripter

## Features

-   **Media Transcription:** Convert media files (audio/video) to text with high accuracy.
-   **Scalable:** Utilizes a distributed architecture to handle multiple transcription requests in parallel.
-   **Real-time Notifications:** Uses Redis Pub-Sub for real-time notifications.

## Architecture

SoundScripter's architecture is designed to handle transcription requests efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **User Requests:** Users uploads video/audio files for transcription through API.

2. **Optimization:** Media files are optimized to be utilized for transcription service.

3. **RabbitMQ Message Broker:** Transcription requests are added to the RabbitMQ message broker.

4. **Celery Task Queue:** Celery task queues manages and distribute the tasks. When new tasks are added to the queue, Celery workers pick them up and process them asynchronously and concurrently.

5. **Task Execution:** Each task runs in its own container, allowing for parallel processing of multiple tasks based on the system configuration.

6. **Realtime Notifications:** SoundScripter leverages Redis Pub-Sub and Server-Side Events (SSE) for real-time notifications.

## Getting Started

To run SoundScripter locally or in a server environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hitesh22rana/SoundScripter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. Configuration

    - You can configure various settings, such as RabbitMQ connection details and task priorities, in the `docker-compose.yml` files.
    - Environment variables are stored in `.env`. Refer `.env.example` for a template of the required variables. Make sure to create a `.env` file with your specific configuration before running the application.

4. Requirements Check

    Before running the application, it's important to ensure that system meets the essential requirements in order to run the application. You can use the `check-requirements.sh` script to verify this:

    ```bash
    ./check-requirements.sh
    ```

5. Build and run the application

    i. First build the transcription service

    ```bash
    docker build -t transcription-service -f Dockerfile.transcription-service .
    ```

    ii. Now, run the docker-compose file to bind all the services

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
    ```

6. Now you backend is up and running and you can access the API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
